# API Reference

All API endpoints are formally documented using the OpenAPI specification. This specification provides a detailed and interactive reference for all available endpoints, including request parameters, response schemas, and authentication methods.

## OpenAPI Specification

The source of truth for the API is the `openapi.yaml` file located in the `../api/` directory.

- **Location:** `../api/openapi.yaml`

## Viewing the API Documentation

To view the interactive API documentation (e.g., using Swagger UI or ReDoc), you can use one of the following methods:

1.  **Local Swagger UI:**
    - If the project includes a local Swagger UI setup, run the application and navigate to the `/api-docs` endpoint in your browser.
    - Example: `http://localhost:8080/swagger/index.html` (based on existing files)

2.  **Online Editors:**
    - You can copy the contents of the `openapi.yaml` file and paste it into a web-based editor like the [Swagger Editor](https://editor.swagger.io/) to view the documentation.

For detailed information on each endpoint, please refer to the `openapi.yaml` file.
