# DSL Bypass Module

This document provides an overview of the DSL Bypass module for K2Ray.

## Overview

The DSL Bypass module is an advanced feature designed to optimize your network connection by interfacing directly with Keenetic modems. It allows for the manipulation of DSL line parameters to potentially achieve higher connection speeds and stability.

## Features

- **Keenetic Modem Integration**: Directly communicates with Keenetic devices.
- **DSL Parameter Optimization**: Allows for fine-tuning of line parameters.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides a dashboard to monitor the status and performance of your DSL connection.
- **Academic Research Support**: Includes tools for logging and data collection for research purposes.

## Configuration

*(Details on how to configure the DSL bypass feature will be added here.)*

## Usage

The DSL Bypass functionality can be accessed through the "DSL Bypass" tab in the main web interface. From there, you can view the current status and initiate optimization processes.

## Safety

This is an advanced feature and should be used with caution. Incorrectly configuring DSL parameters can lead to an unstable connection. It is recommended to have a good understanding of DSL technology before using this module. An emergency rollback feature is planned to revert to safe settings.
