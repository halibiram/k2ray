## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

This section provides a brief overview of how to get the project running. For more detailed instructions, please refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

### ‚úÖ System Requirements

*   **Go**: Version 1.24 or higher
*   **Node.js**: Version 18 or higher (with npm)
*   **V2Ray**: A running instance of V2Ray that k2ray can manage.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/halibiram/k2ray.git
    cd k2ray
    ```

2.  **Setup the Backend (API Server):**
    ```bash
    # Run the development server
    go run ./cmd/k2ray
    ```
    The API server will start, typically on port `8080`.

3.  **Setup the Frontend (Web UI):**
    ```bash
    # Navigate to the web directory
    cd web

    # Install dependencies
    npm install

    # Run the development server
    npm run dev
    ```
    The frontend development server will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173`.

## üß™ Testing

This project is equipped with a comprehensive suite of tests and quality assurance tools to ensure code reliability and maintainability.

### Backend (Go)

All backend tests can be run from the root of the project using the `Makefile`.

*   **Run all unit and integration tests:**
    ```bash
    make test
    ```

*   **Run tests with code coverage:**
    This will generate a `coverage.out` file, which can be used by code analysis tools.
    ```bash
    make test-coverage
    ```

*   **Run the linter (`golangci-lint`):**
    To generate a JSON report for SonarQube integration, use:
    ```bash
    make lint-report
    ```

### Frontend (Vue.js)

All frontend tests and scripts should be run from within the `web/` directory.

*   **Run component tests (`vitest`):**
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm test
    ```

*   **Run component tests with code coverage:**
    This generates reports in `web/tests/coverage/`, including `lcov.info` for SonarQube.
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run test:coverage
    ```

*   **Run the E2E Smoke Test:**
    This test verifies that the frontend and backend servers can start and that the frontend serves the correct initial page.
    *Note: This requires both the backend and frontend servers to be running.*
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run test:smoke
    ```

*   **Lint and Format Code:**
    To check for linting errors:
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run lint
    ```
    To automatically format the code with Prettier:
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run format
    ```
    To generate a JSON report for SonarQube integration:
    ```bash
    cd web
    npm run lint:report
    ```
